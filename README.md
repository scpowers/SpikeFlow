# SpikeFlow: Event-Based Optical Flow Estimation Using Hybrid Artificial/Spiking Neural Networks

This project uses the network architecture and event frame discretization method proposed in "Spike-FlowNet: Event-based Optical Flow Estimation with Energy-Efficient Hybrid Neural Networks" by Lee et al.: [Spike-FlowNet: Event-based Optical Flow Estimation with Energy-Efficient Hybrid Neural Networks, ECCV 2020](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-58526-6_22).

At present, this re-implementation is purely meant to be a learning exercise; it will force me to learn about self-supervised learning, optical flow estimation, and integrating SNNs and ANNs into a coherent architecture that harnesses the best of both worlds.
